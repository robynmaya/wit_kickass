# Practice Full-Stack Development Workspace

This workspace contains multiple mini full-stack applications for practicing React with different backend technologies:

## Apps Structure
- `react-python-app/` - React frontend with Python (Flask/FastAPI) backend
- `react-rails-app/` - React frontend with Ruby on Rails backend  
- `react-express-app/` - React frontend with Node.js Express backend

## Development Guidelines
- Each app directory is self-contained with its own package.json, requirements, and README
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Implement proper API patterns and error handling
- Focus on small, iterative features for learning
- Each app should be runnable locally with simple commands

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for React components when possible
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Implement proper CORS handling for local development
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Add basic error handling and validation
